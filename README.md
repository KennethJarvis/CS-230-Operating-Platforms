# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room client hired our team to develop a web-based game called "Win It or Lose It." The game was already available on Android, and they wanted to expand to all platforms. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Having some experience in the Information Technology field, I understood the hardware needed to execute the customer's needs. I was aware of vulnerabilities in the Windows operating system and knew security would key in the design. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document helped me think about the building process, where I needed to start and set the proper steps to succeed. When the process was ordered, I could concentrate on each step and think about security, bandwidth, hardware, and software that best suited the project. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

When I started this class, I discussed how I used Windows and Android most of the time. That got me thinking about widening the scope of my knowledge of operating systems. I went out and bought a Mac and fired up a Linux VM on my computer. Over the last two months, these two new OSs have grown on me. I don't have to worry about viruses as much now, and less processing power is required to run. I would change my server to Linux and spend more time building it for the customer. Yes, there is a higher risk of incompatibility with hardware, but it is worth it in the long run. 

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

The customer wanted a game that was compatible across all platforms. I ensured I programmed with an IDE and code that was also versatile in the same way. That was important because re-coding the same components was unnecessary, saving time and resources.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software using the agile method. Since there wasn't a precedent for a game like this that was available, agile allowed the team to improvise the software using feedback from the customer. Agile is flexible enough to allow constant adjustments without stopping the entire development process. In the future, I would implement the successful strategies, then build on the opportunities and create a better plan with the experience gained.
